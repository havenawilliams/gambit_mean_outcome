# gambit_mean_outcome
The python script in this directory calculates the average payoff of an extended form game using Gambit. Rigirously, the average payoff in an extensive game is the utility to each player of a mixed strategy profile as a function of a perfect Bayesian equilibria for the game. What this means is that, in a game where players take turns, this script returns the average value of a turn-taking game where players can anticipate the moves of their opponent.

I find that the official documentation for this issue is lacking, so I've provided this short writing sample for those intersting in accessing the expected payoff of an extensive game.

Thank you!

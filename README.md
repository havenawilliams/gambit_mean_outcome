# gambit_mean_outcome
The python script in this directory is a very simple way of calculating the average payoff of an extended form game using Gambit. I find that the official documentation for this issue is lacking, so I've provided this short writing sample for those intersting in accessing the expected payoff of an extensive game.

Thank you!
